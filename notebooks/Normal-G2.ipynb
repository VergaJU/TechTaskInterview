This score was derived from the expression levels of specific genes from the PAM50 panel known to have high centroid values for the Normal-like subtype. The color bar indicates the range of the score, where samples with higher Normal-like scores are depicted in yellow/green, and samples with lower scores are in purple/blue.\n",

These clusters were previously identified based on the analysis and represent different breast cancer subtypes combined with Nottingham Histologic Grade (G2 or G3): Basal-G3, Her2-G2, Her2-G3, LumA-G2, LumB-G3, and Normal-G2, as indicated by the legend.\n",

The spatial distribution of samples exhibiting high \"Normal - scores\" (left panel) strongly overlaps with the region primarily occupied by samples assigned to the Normal-G2 cluster (right panel), located distinctly from the main tumor subtype clusters. This visual correspondence confirms that the calculated Normal score effectively identifies samples with a gene expression signature characteristic of the Normal-like subtype and validates that the clustering method successfully grouped these samples together based on this molecular characteristic."

Scores for other centroids (Basal, Luminal B, Her2) are significantly lower. The stacked bar plots on the right reveal the composition of this cluster based on standard PAM50 calls and clinical grade: the majority of samples (72.3%) are classified as Luminal A by PAM50, with a substantial minority (20.9%) classified as Normal-like. Histologically, the cluster is predominantly Grade 2 (59.2%), with a significant proportion being Grade 1 (29.1%), justifying the \"G2\" part of the cluster name. This figure indicates that the Normal-G2 cluster, while containing a large proportion of Luminal A tumors with lower histological grades (G1/G2), is characterized by gene expression patterns that also show considerable similarity to the Normal-like subtype, leading to their grouping in the UMAP space."

A positive NES signifies significant enrichment and generally increased gene expression of the pathway in the Normal-G2 cluster compared to the other samples.

    "Interpretation: The GSEA reveals that pathways related to cell cycle progression, proliferation, and key metabolic processes are significantly negatively enriched (downregulated) in the Normal-G2 cluster compared to other breast cancer subtypes in the cohort. The most prominent negatively enriched pathways include those associated with cell cycle regulation (HALLMARK_E2F_TARGETS, HALLMARK_G2M_CHECKPOINT), cell growth and signaling (HALLMARK_MYC_TARGETS_V1/V2, HALLMARK_MTORC1_SIGNALING), and energy metabolism (HALLMARK_OXIDATIVE_PHOSPHORYLATION, HALLMARK_GLYCOLYSIS), as well as HALLMARK_DNA_REPAIR and HALLMARK_UNFOLDED_PROTEIN_RESPONSE. This pattern of pathway suppression aligns with the predominantly lower histological grade (G1/G2) and less aggressive nature of the samples constituting this cluster, which includes a large proportion of Luminal A tumors and samples with a Normal-like PAM50 signature. The only positively enriched pathway among the top ranked is HALLMARK_UV_RESPONSE_DN, which is anti-correlation with UV response. All displayed enrichments are highly statistically significant, indicated by the predominantly green/yellow bubble colors reflecting very low FDR q-values."
