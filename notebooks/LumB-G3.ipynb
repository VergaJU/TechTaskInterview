This score was derived from the expression levels of specific genes from the PAM50 panel known to have high centroid values for the Luminal B subtype. The color bar indicates the range of the score, where samples with higher Luminal B scores are depicted in yellow/green, and samples with lower scores are in purple/blue.\n",

These clusters were previously identified based on the analysis and represent different breast cancer subtypes combined with Nottingham Histologic Grade (G2 or G3): Basal-G3, Her2-G2, Her2-G3, LumA-G2, LumB-G3, and Normal-G2, as indicated by the legend.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation: The UMAP projection effectively separates the samples into distinct regions corresponding to the different molecular subtypes. The spatial distribution of samples exhibiting high Luminal B scores (left panel) shows a strong overlap with the region primarily occupied by samples assigned to the LumB-G3 cluster (right panel). This visual correspondence confirms that the calculated Luminal B score effectively identifies samples with a strong Luminal B-enriched gene expression signature and validates that the clustering method successfully grouped these samples together based on this molecular characteristic, particularly those with a Grade 3 histology. The Luminal B cluster appears adjacent to the Luminal A cluster in the UMAP space, consistent with their shared hormone receptor-positive nature, but distinct based on their LumB/LumA scoring profiles."

Each violin shows the density distribution of how strongly these samples score against the average gene expression profile (centroid) of each of the five intrinsic PAM50 subtypes (Basal-like, Luminal A, Luminal B, Her2-enriched, and Normal-like). Embedded box plots indicate the median and interquartile range.

The legend specifies the color assigned to each subtype and grade category. This plot visualizes the molecular and histological composition of this specific cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation: The violin plots on the left indicate that samples within the LumB-G3 cluster score highest against the Luminal B centroid, but also show substantial scores for the Luminal A centroid and relatively low scores for Basal and Her2 centroids. This molecular profile is consistent with their classification as Luminal tumors, particularly Luminal B which typically exhibits higher proliferation than Luminal A. The stacked bar plots on the right confirm the cluster's composition: the majority (66.7%) are assigned the Luminal B PAM50 subtype, with a significant proportion (26.5%) also classified as Luminal A. Clinically, this cluster is predominantly composed of samples with Histological Grade 3 (54.8%), with a large number also being Grade 2 (39.2%), justifying the \"G3\" designation as the most frequent grade. This figure demonstrates that the LumB-G3 cluster is primarily defined by a Luminal B molecular signature and high histological grade, but contains molecular heterogeneity including a substantial proportion of Luminal A samples."

    "\n",
    "- Bubble Size: Represents the percentage of genes within the gene set that are part of the leading edge, meaning they contribute most significantly to the enrichment score. Larger bubbles denote that a higher proportion of the gene set members are driving the enrichment.\n",

    "- Bubble Color: Indicates the statistical significance of the enrichment result, specifically represented by log10(1/FDR). Higher values (more yellow/green colors) correspond to lower False Discovery Rate (FDR) q-values, denoting higher statistical confidence in the enrichment result. Lower values (purple/blue) indicate less significance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation: The GSEA reveals a mixed set of biological pathways enriched in the LumB-G3 cluster. Consistent with the more aggressive nature of Luminal B subtypes compared to Luminal A and their high histological grade (G3), pathways associated with cell cycle progression and proliferation, such as HALLMARK_E2F_TARGETS, HALLMARK_G2M_CHECKPOINT, and HALLMARK_MYC_TARGETS, are significantly positively enriched (upregulated). Metabolic pathways like HALLMARK_OXIDATIVE_PHOSPHORYLATION and HALLMARK_UNFOLDED_PROTEIN_RESPONSE, as well as HALLMARK_DNA_REPAIR, are also positively enriched. As expected for a Luminal subtype, HALLMARK_ESTROGEN_RESPONSE (Early and Late) are positively enriched.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, several pathways commonly associated with more aggressive or treatment-resistant subtypes (like Basal-like) are significantly negatively enriched (downregulated) in the LumB-G3 cluster. These include processes related to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (HALLMARK_EPITHELIAL_MESENCHYMAL_TRANSITION), immune and inflammatory responses (HALLMARK_ALLOGRAFT_REJECTION, HALLMARK_INFLAMMATORY_RESPONSE, HALLMARK_TNFA_SIGNALING_VIA_NFKB, HALLMARK_IL2_STAT5_SIGNALING, HALLMARK_IL6_JAK_STAT3_SIGNALING, HALLMARK_COMPLEMENT), KRAS signaling (HALLMARK_KRAS_SIGNALING_UP), cell adhesion (HALLMARK_APICAL_JUNCTION), and various developmental/signaling pathways (HALLMARK_TGF_BETA_SIGNALING, HALLMARK_HEDGEHOG_SIGNALING, HALLMARK_WNT_BETA_CATENIN_SIGNALING, HALLMARK_NOTCH_SIGNALING). This suggests that while proliferative activity is high in LumB-G3, features related to immune infiltration, mesenchymal characteristics, and specific oncogenic signaling cascades are relatively less prominent compared to other subtypes in the cohort. The majority of the displayed enrichments are highly statistically significant, indicated by the predominantly green/yellow bubble colors reflecting very low FDR q-values."
