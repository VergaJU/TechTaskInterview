    "This figure displays Kaplan-Meier curves illustrating the estimated overall survival probability over time for patients grouped by the six identified breast cancer gene expression clusters: Basal-G3, LumA-G2, LumB-G3, Her2-G2, Her2-G3, and Normal-G2.\n",

    "- X-axis: Represents the follow-up time from diagnosis or sample collection, shown in days.\n",

    "Interpretation: The Kaplan-Meier curves reveal substantial heterogeneity in estimated overall survival across the identified molecular clusters. The Normal-G2 and LumA-G2 clusters demonstrate the most favorable estimated overall survival outcomes, with the highest survival probabilities maintained throughout the observation period. The Basal-G3 cluster shows the least favorable prognosis, with the steepest decline in estimated survival probability. The LumB-G3 cluster exhibits intermediate survival outcomes, better than the Basal and Her2 groups but worse than LumA-G2 and Normal-G2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notably, among the Her2-classified clusters, the Her2-G2 cluster displays unexpectedly poor survival, with its curve falling consistently below the Her2-G3 cluster and tracking closely with the curve for the Basal-G3 cluster. This visual observation is counter-intuitive given that Grade 2 tumors typically have a better prognosis than Grade 3, and highlights that the molecular characteristics captured by this Her2-G2 cluster may contribute to a more aggressive clinical behavior than suggested by grade alone. These distinct survival profiles emphasize the prognostic relevance of the identified clusters and warrant further investigation into the biological underpinnings driving the poorer outcomes observed in Basal-G3 and this specific Her2-G2 cluster. Statistical analysis (e.g., Cox regression) is necessary to quantify the hazard differences and assess their significance."

    "This figure displays the estimated log of the Hazard Ratio (log(HR)) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals for overall survival, comparing each identified cluster to the Her2-G3 cluster. The results were derived from a Cox Proportional Hazards model fitted to the breast cancer cohort (n=3273 observations, 336 events). The Her2-G3 cluster served as the reference group in this model.\n",

    "Interpretation: The Cox model results show significant differences in overall survival hazard among several clusters compared to Her2-G3. The Basal-G3 cluster exhibits a significantly increased hazard (log(HR) 0.53, 95% CI: 0.18-0.88, p<0.005), indicating poorer overall survival compared to Her2-G3. Conversely, the LumA-G2 (log(HR) -0.52, 95% CI: -0.83--0.20, p<0.005), LumB-G3 (log(HR) -0.41, 95% CI: -0.78--0.04, p=0.03), and Normal-G2 (log(HR) -0.72, 95% CI: -1.09--0.35, p<0.005) clusters all show significantly decreased hazard (better overall survival) compared to Her2-G3. The Her2-G2 cluster shows an estimated log(HR) of 0.41 (95% CI: -0.19-1.01), indicating a trend towards higher hazard than Her2-G3, but the 95% confidence interval crosses 0, meaning this difference is not statistically significant (p=0.18) in this model. This aligns with the observation from the Kaplan-Meier plot where Her2-G2 survival tracked similarly to Basal-G3 but did not show a statistically distinct hazard from Her2-G3 in the Cox model. The overall Cox model demonstrates good predictive power (concordance = 0.61) and is highly statistically significant (Likelihood ratio test p < 0.005)."
