The color bar indicates the range of the score, where samples with higher Her2 scores are depicted in yellow/green, and samples with lower scores are in purple/blue.\n",

This visual correspondence confirms that the calculated Her2 score effectively identifies samples with a strong Her2-enriched gene expression signature and validates that the clustering method successfully grouped these samples together based on this molecular characteristic, while also capturing potential histological grade differences within the Her2 subtype."

While the Her2 scores are highest, there are also notable distributions for the Normal and Luminal A centroids, suggesting some molecular heterogeneity or transitional states within this group. The stacked bar plots on the right confirm the cluster's classification: the majority (59.0%) are assigned the Her2 PAM50 subtype, with smaller but significant proportions of Normal (21.3%) and LumA (18.0%) subtypes also present. Clinically, the cluster is predominantly composed of samples with Histological Grade 2 (45.9%), with a substantial minority of Grade 3 (47.5%), justifying the \"G2\" label primarily reflecting the most frequent grade, though noting the presence of G3 cases is important (especially in contrast to a potential separate Her2-G3 cluster). This figure highlights the molecular profile and histological grade composition of the Her2-G2 cluster."

    "Interpretation: The GSEA reveals a distinct set of biological pathways differentiating the Her2-G2 cluster from the rest of the cohort. Pathways associated with various metabolic processes are significantly positively enriched (upregulated) in Her2-G2, including HALLMARK_MTORC1_SIGNALING, HALLMARK_XENOBIOTIC_METABOLISM, HALLMARK_ADIPOGENESIS, HALLMARK_CHOLESTEROL_HOMEOSTASIS, HALLMARK_FATTY_ACID_METABOLISM, HALLMARK_REACTIVE_OXYGEN_SPECIES_PATHWAY, HALLMARK_OXIDATIVE_PHOSPHORYLATION, and HALLMARK_PEROXISOME. Additionally, HALLMARK_ANDROGEN_RESPONSE and some immune/inflammatory pathways like HALLMARK_INFLAMMATORY_RESPONSE, HALLMARK_COMPLEMENT, and HALLMARK_ALLOGRAFT_REJECTION show positive enrichment. In contrast, pathways strongly linked to cell cycle progression and proliferation, including HALLMARK_MITOTIC_SPINDLE, HALLMARK_E2F_TARGETS, and HALLMARK_G2M_CHECKPOINT, are significantly negatively enriched (downregulated) in the Her2-G2 cluster. Similarly, HALLMARK_ESTROGEN_RESPONSE_EARLY is also negatively enriched. This suggests that while this cluster is defined by a Her2 signature and includes G2/G3 tumors, it exhibits lower proliferative activity and estrogen signaling compared to other subtypes in the cohort, potentially driven by specific metabolic and signaling adaptations. Most of the displayed enrichments are highly statistically significant, indicated by the predominantly yellow/green bubble colors."
