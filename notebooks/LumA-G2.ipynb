This score was derived from the expression levels of 10 genes from the PAM50 panel known to have high centroid values for the Luminal A subtype. The color bar indicates the range of the score, where samples with higher Luminal A scores are depicted in yellow/green, and samples with lower scores are in purple/blue.\n",

These clusters were identified based on the analysis and represent different breast cancer subtypes combined with Nottingham Histologic Grade (G2 or G3): Basal-G3, Her2-G2, Her2-G3, LumA-G2, LumB-G3, and Normal-G2, as indicated by the legend.\n",

Notably, the spatial distribution of samples with high Luminal A scores (left panel) strongly aligns with the region occupied by the LumA-G2 cluster (right panel). This indicates that the calculated Luminal A score effectively captures the molecular characteristics defining the Luminal A subtype, differentiating it from other subtypes like Basal and Her2 which show significantly lower Luminal A scores in their respective regions of the UMAP space."

    "Interpretation: The GSEA reveals key biological processes that differentiate the LumA-G2 cluster. The most positively enriched pathway (highest positive NES) is HALLMARK_ESTROGEN_RESPONSE_EARLY, consistent with the known hormone receptor-positive nature of Luminal A breast cancers. Conversely, several pathways are significantly negatively enriched (downregulated) in the LumA-G2 cluster relative to other subtypes. These include pathways related to immune response (HALLMARK_INTERFERON_GAMMA_RESPONSE, HALLMARK_ALLOGRAFT_REJECTION, HALLMARK_INFLAMMATORY_RESPONSE, HALLMARK_TNFA_SIGNALING_VIA_NFKB, HALLMARK_COMPLEMENT), cell cycle and proliferation (HALLMARK_E2F_TARGETS, HALLMARK_G2M_CHECKPOINT), and signaling (HALLMARK_IL6_JAK_STAT3_SIGNALING). This pattern of high estrogen signaling coupled with lower immune/inflammatory and proliferative pathway activity supports the characterization of LumA-G2 as a less proliferative and perhaps less immune-infiltrated subtype compared to other breast cancer classes present in the dataset. All shown enrichments are highly statistically significant, indicated by the predominantly high log10(1/FDR) values (green/yellow colors) and very low FDR q-values (all 0.0 for the top entries based on your provided data)."
