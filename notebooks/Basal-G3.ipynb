The spatial distribution of samples with high Basal scores (left panel) strongly coincides with the region primarily occupied by samples assigned to the Basal-G3 cluster (right panel). This visual alignment demonstrates that the calculated Basal score accurately reflects the molecular characteristics distinguishing the Basal subtype and confirms that the clustering approach successfully identified this specific group, particularly those with a Grade 3 histology."

Samples within this cluster show overwhelmingly high scores for the Basal centroid and correspondingly low scores for the Luminal A and Luminal B centroids. This molecular profile is consistent with their assignment to the Basal subtype. The stacked bar plots on the right further validate the cluster definition: the vast majority (97.0%) of samples within this cluster are classified as Basal by PAM50, and a high proportion (91.4%) are assigned Histological Grade 3. This figure confirms that the Basal-G3 cluster is molecularly defined by a strong Basal signature and clinically characterized by high-grade histology."

    "Interpretation: The GSEA identifies several key biological pathways significantly enriched in the Basal-G3 cluster. Consistent with the highly proliferative nature and high histological grade (G3) characteristic of many Basal-like breast cancers, pathways related to cell cycle progression and proliferation such as HALLMARK_E2F_TARGETS, HALLMARK_G2M_CHECKPOINT, and HALLMARK_MITOTIC_SPINDLE are among the most highly positively enriched. Pathways associated with immune and inflammatory responses, including HALLMARK_INTERFERON_GAMMA_RESPONSE, HALLMARK_ALLOGRAFT_REJECTION, HALLMARK_INTERFERON_ALPHA_RESPONSE, HALLMARK_INFLAMMATORY_RESPONSE, and HALLMARK_IL6_JAK_STAT3_SIGNALING, also show significant positive enrichment, suggesting increased immune activity in this cluster. Additionally, HALLMARK_MYC_TARGETS (V1 and V2) and HALLMARK_MTORC1_SIGNALING are positively enriched, reflecting activated oncogenic signaling. In contrast, HALLMARK_ESTROGEN_RESPONSE_EARLY is significantly negatively enriched, consistent with the hormone receptor-negative status typical of Basal-like breast cancers. All shown gene sets are highly statistically significant with very low FDR q-values."
